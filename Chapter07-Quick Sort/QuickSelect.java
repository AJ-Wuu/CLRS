//Quickselect (Hoare's Selection Algorithm)
//It's typically used to solve the problems "find kth something": kth smallest, kth largest, kth most frequent, kth less frequent, etc.
//It has O(N) average time complexity. Though its worth case time complexity is O(N^2), the probability of this worst-case is negligible.
